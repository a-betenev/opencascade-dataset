Open CASCADE Technology test data set repo
==========================================

This repo contains data files used by
[OCCT tests](https://dev.opencascade.org/doc/overview/html/occt_contribution__tests.html).

The data files come from two primary sources:

* Official datasets published with OCCT releases
* Additional data extracted from attachments to publicly accessible issues in 
  [OCCT bug tracker](https://tracker.dev.opencascade.org)

The additional files are found in bug tracker using the script `getocctdata.tcl`
located in `scripts`.
